** state transistion table and lock semantics
   For the various use cases, the locking / waiting semantics must be handled appropriately
   as defined below:

   |                    |   | initial | write                   | read                      |
   | properties         |   | stale   | no_wait go_fresh        | wait_for_fresh stay_fresh |
   | notifications      |   | stale   | no_wait go_fresh        | wait_for_fresh go_stale   |
   | methods and events |   | stale   | wait_for_stale go_fresh | wait_for_fresh go_stale   |

   Here, a "write" with regards to a method is simply the outgoing method call,
   and the same for an event -- an outgoing event

   Here, a "read" with regards to a method is simply the "caller" responding,
   and the same with the event -- incoming, event received.
